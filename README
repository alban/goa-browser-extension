GNOME Online Accounts Integration browser extension
===================================================

This browser extension integrates your browser with GNOME Online Accounts,
offering you to register your accounts when you log in a supported service.

To build the extension from a release tarball, the usual autotool procedure
should be followed:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

If you're building from a Git clone, run the autogen.sh script instead
of the configure one. The autogen.sh script will run the configure script
for you, unless the NOCONFIGURE environment variable is set to a non-empty
value.
